## Q&A
### How long did you take to do this master piece?
1,5h. Hence the **awesome** code

### Why don't you remove the location bar

There's something called pull requests. Feel free to do it. Maybe the scrollTo(0,0) still works, don't know.

### What about feature **X**

There's something called pull requests. Feel free to add whatever. You can find me learning important stuff at the 6th floor when the pull request is ready.
